                    You are invited to participate in the Annual Operations Job Market Survey (the
                    “<b>Survey</b>”). The Survey is being conducted by <a href=
                    "http://www.stouras.com/">Konstantinos I. Stouras</a> (the “<b>Researcher</b>”)
                    and is provided by the website <a href=
                    "http://www.operationsacademia.org/">Operations Academia</a> (the
                    “<b>Site</b>”).<br>
                    <br>
                    The purpose of the Survey is to examine newly hired Operations faculty members’
                    profiles and their professional and academic career choices following PhD
                    graduation. Your participation in this survey will contribute to a better
                    understanding of how PhD Students of Operations performed their search for an
                    academic placement related to Operations, as well as what they do after
                    graduating. You are free to <a href="contact">contact the Researcher</a> with
                    any additional questions.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>If you agree to participate:</b><br>
                    The Survey will take approximately 15 minutes of your time, although it could
                    take longer depending on your answers. Participation will involve answering
                    questions about a variety of topics that may include your job search and
                    profile, and characteristics of the institution that hired you and the
                    placement you accepted.

                    the Researcher during the data collection phase for tracking purposes only.
                    Email addresses may be used in case you have provided them during the Survey,
                    to inform you about the outcomes of the Survey, but this information will not
                    be directly associated with your responses. The Researcher will have access to

                    participants will be kept confidential by the Researcher; the final Annual
                    Report of the Survey will be based on aggregated data and where there are less

                    will be protected to the extent permitted by law. Other than as described in

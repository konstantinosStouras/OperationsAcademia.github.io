# Repository conventions

This repo is the source of **operationsacademia.org** (the Operations job
market site), served by GitHub Pages from `master`. The rebuilt site serves
from the ROOT since the 2026-08-16 cutover; the old site is archived at
`/v1/` and `/v2/` holds only redirect stubs from the preview era. No build
step — HTML/CSS/JS are committed and served as-is; the data files under
`data/` are written by the GitHub Actions workflows (`_scraper/` +
`.github/workflows/oa-*.yml`) from Firestore, which is the source of truth
for submissions.

`_PLAN.md` is the architecture plan and decision log — consult it before
structural changes (which pages are rebuilt, which are legacy, what is
scheduled for retirement). `_AUDIT.md` records the content audit.

## Two sources of job postings, and only one of them is the database

`data/jobs.json` is built by `_scraper/build-jobs.mjs` from **both**:

1. **`jobSubmissions` in Firestore** — everything posted through the site's own
   form. The database is the source of truth for these: they are edited,
   withdrawn and hidden there, which is why the old form-sheet sync was retired
   (re-reading a sheet reverted people's edits — see the header of
   `oa-jobs-sheet-sync.yml`).
2. **The maintainer's job market TRACKING SHEET** — one Google workbook per
   market cycle, a tab per kind of position ("2026 Jobs", "2026 NTT/PD"), read
   daily into `data/jobmarket.json` by `_scraper/sync-jobmarket-sheet.mjs`
   (`.github/workflows/oa-jobmarket-sheet.yml`). Setup and behaviour:
   **`_SETUP-JOBMARKET-SHEET.md`**.

The ownership is opposite, and that is the whole design. A posting from the
tracking sheet is **maintained in the sheet**: it is rebuilt from the workbook
on every run, an edit there reaches the site, and a row DELETED there comes off
the site. So those rows are deliberately never copied into Firestore —
`migratable()` in `migrate-to-firestore.mjs` skips them, because a document
would win over the sheet at the next build and a deleted row could never leave.
For the same reason they are excluded from the orphan carry in `build-jobs.mjs`
(a missing `data/jobmarket.json` still removes nothing — only a file that
exists and no longer lists a posting does).

**When the sheet changes shape, fix it in `_scraper/jobmarket-sheet.mjs` —
never by hand-editing `data/`.** That file is rewritten from the workbook every
morning, so a patched row comes back the next day, exactly as with the country
spellings below. Columns are matched by header alias and a header it does not
know is REPORTED in the run's log rather than guessed at; add the alias there.

A sheet that stops being updated looks exactly like a quiet job market from the
site, so it is made visible deliberately: `stalenessOf`/`shouldWarn` e-mail the
maintainer once (then weekly) when the sheet has gained nothing for three weeks,
cannot be read, or reads as empty. Nothing already published is ever removed by
one of those failures.

## Mobile standards for tables and lists — MUST consult

**Before building or changing ANY table / card-list page (job postings,
candidates, placements, past markets, or a new one), read
`_MOBILE-STANDARDS.md` and follow it.** In short: mount the shared `OAList`
engine (`assets/oa-list.js` + `assets/oa-list.css`) so the mobile rules are
inherited rather than re-implemented, and add the new page to the
`MOBILE_PAGES` list in `_scraper/page-test.mjs` in the same change. When a
new rule is needed, add it to `_MOBILE-STANDARDS.md` in the same change that
first applies it — the file is the living standard, not a snapshot.

## One spelling per country

`assets/oa-countries.js` is the **single definition** of what each country is
called — a dual-mode file (browser `window.OACountries`, Node `require`), like
`assets/oa-alert-match.js`. It holds the canonical `LIST` the posting form
offers, an `ALIASES` table, and `canon()`.

The country is free text on the form and was free text in the spreadsheets the
archive came from, so one country arrived under several names ("USA"/"UK"/"Hong
Kong SAR"/"Shenzhen, China"), each becoming its own entry in the jobs page's
Location filter. Canonical names are the **full** ones: `United States`, not
`USA`.

**When a new variant turns up, add it to `ALIASES` — never hand-edit the data.**
`data/jobs.json` is rebuilt from Firestore every morning, so a patched row comes
back the next day, whereas an alias fixes it permanently and for every past row
at once. `canon()` never invents: a country it does not recognise is published
under the name its poster gave it.

It is applied at every ingest (`jobs-model.rowFromSubmission`,
`import-sheet.mjs`) and on both sides of every comparison in the alert matcher —
that last one matters, because an alert saved under an old spelling would
otherwise stop matching silently.

## Tests that must stay green

    node _scraper/selftest.mjs      # offline model/pipeline checks
    node _scraper/page-test.mjs     # Playwright browser checks, incl. the
                                    # 390px mobile gate over every list page
                                    # (PW_CHROMIUM=<path> pins the browser)

Both run in CI on every push (`.github/workflows/oa-checks.yml`); the jobs
build also runs the selftest AFTER writing `data/` and refuses to commit on
a failure, so a red selftest silently stops publishing — fix it promptly.

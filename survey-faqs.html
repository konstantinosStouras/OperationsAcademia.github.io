										Apart from having a&nbsp;clean place&nbsp;to keep track of the
										currently available job openings and the profiles of the PhD
										Candidates on the Job Market, we also aim to collect data on the
										profiles of the people who accepted an Operations related academic
										job.
									</p>

									<p style='text-align: justify';>
										Some FAQs regarding the Survey are the following:
									</p>

									<p style='text-align: justify';>
										<b>1. Who should fill out the Survey?</b><br>
										Whoever recently went through the Job Market search for an Operations
										related academic position at a University/Business School, at any
										level (PostDoc, Assist. Prof, Assoc. Prof, etc). Our Annual Job
										Market Survey asks you to report the year you were on the Market and
										the year you are starting to work (in case you defer an academic
										position for a PostDoc or a corporate offer).
									</p>

									<p style='text-align: justify';>
										<b>2. What if I accepted a position as an Assistant Professor at an
										Industrial Engineering/ Analytics/ etc department of a University
										(but not at its Business School)?</b><br>
										You should fill out our Survey, signaling though you are not joining
										a Business School Department, at the respective question-section of
										the Survey.
									</p>

									<p style='text-align: justify';>
										<b>3. What if I am graduating this (academic) year and accepted a
										position a year from now, going for a year of PostDoc or some months
										in the Industry in between?</b><br>
										You should fill out our Survey mentioning you accepted a PostDoc or a
										position in the industry till you start your academic position.
										<a href="contact.html" target=
										"_blank">Please contact us if anything is not clear</a>.
									</p>

									<p style='text-align: justify';>
										<b>4. What do you plan to do with my data?</b><br>
										We aim to create concrete annual reports, that would describe our
										field and make our Job Market more transparent and efficient.
										<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15DxKOXE06x40BeD9phNi5Yuc-sE5l5bwN3OlKtBvI_Y"
										target="_blank">Here is a preliminary report from data collected in
										the very first year we run this Annual Survey</a>. We are inspired by
										a <a href=
										"http://docsig.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-Who-Went-Where-Presentation.pdf"
										target="_blank">similar Annual Survey that is being published in the
										field of Marketing every year</a>.
									</p>

									<p style='text-align: justify';>
										<b>5. I really liked the idea of having real data from the Operations
										Job Market every year and better inform next generations of
										Operations PhDs and Faculty. However, I am a bit hesitant to answer
										your Survey's sensitive salary questions, mainly because I am afraid
										one could reverse engineer your report and find out my identity. How
										would you deal with such cases?</b><br>
										We are fully aware of these concerns and take them very seriously. We
										make sure that your anonymity is assured in two ways. The first way
										is by not displaying any data that can be traced back to individuals.
										Specifically, this means that we do not display data (e.g. averages)
										that have less than three data points. The second way is that these
										data will strictly not be accessed by anyone else except the <a href=
										"faqs.html" target="_blank">moderator of
										this website</a><span style="background-color:transparent">, who will
										also not disclose any data in any other way or form, except through
										the Annual Report. For an example of how the data will (not) be
										displayed, see <a href=
										"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15DxKOXE06x40BeD9phNi5Yuc-sE5l5bwN3OlKtBvI_Y"
										target="_blank">this preliminary report on data collected so far</a>,
										and the tables on pp. 7-8 of the following similar <a href=
										"http://docsig.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013.pdf" style=
										"background-color:transparent" target="_blank">Annual Report from the
										Marketing Academia</a>.</span>
									</p> 
									
									<p style='text-align: justify';><b>6. Hey, the Survey is
										not <i>really</i>&nbsp;anonymous, you may be able to find out my
										identity! Please elaborate further.</b><br>
										First of all, our academic community is not as small as you may
										think. Our Survey is designed so that it can be answered by <i>any
										individual affiliated to "Operations" (broadly defined), who went
										through our Job Market process in the past</i> (provided he/ she
										remembers all the details we ask). This involves PhD Candidates from
										a wide range of disciplines including, but not limited to, Operations
										Research, Management Science, Industrial Engineering, Computer
										Science, Financial Engineering and Analytics (among others), that
										have gone through the "Operations Job Market" search.<br>
										Second, we do not ask anything that the Marketing folks do not. Every
										year, almost 95%(!) of the people who went on the Marketing Job
										Market (around 100 academics per year) fill up a respective Survey
										and keep their Job Market greatly organized. We do not ask you to
										report your name (as they indeed do in Marketing for verification
										reasons!), neither which institution you got your PhD and where you
										finally ended up to. Sure, we do ask you though about how many papers
										you had on the market, and their stage, your teaching load in your
										current institution, the tenure requirements, and more details about
										your job offer.<br>
										Third, "<i>without action the world would still be an idea</i>" to
										rephrase a famous quote of <a href=
										"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Doriot" target="_blank">Georges
										Doriot</a>. Either you trust the researcher who is conducting the
										Survey by accepting the detailed "<a href=
										"informed-consent-statement.html"
										target="_blank">Informed Consent Statement</a>", or not. Provided we
										collect the right data though, we promise you a lot of insights that
										will be helpful for future PhD Students, Universities/ Business
										Schools, and any academic of our field. See for example the following
										recent executive summary reports by the Marketing community (<a href=
										"http://docsig.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013.pdf" target=
										"_blank">2012-2013</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=
										"http://docsig.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014WWW.pdf" target=
										"_blank">2013-2014</a>).</span>
									</p> 
									
									<p style='text-align: justify';><b>7. To whom would this
										Survey be helpful?</b><br>
										We believe that understanding the Business Schools' and Universities'
										job offers and packages, and the average profiles of the Candidates
										will help both parties to adjust their offers and expectations
										accordingly. Furthermore, our vision is on how to attract the best
										(and the right) pool of researchers who even want to <i>enter</i> our
										fields applying for a PhD. Reporting real data will definitely help
										shaping the definition and the boundaries of "Operations
										Academia".</span>
									</p>
									<p p style='text-align: justify';><b>8. I was on the Job
										Market in the past, can I still fill out the Survey?</b><br>
										<i>Yes</i>, provided you remember well all the details of your job
										search process including number of applications you sent, offers you
										got, etc. Our Survey asks you to report the year you were in the job
										market.</span>
									</p>
									<p p style='text-align: justify';><b>9. Where is the link to
										the Survey? When will you report the data you collected so
										far?</b><br>
										Please <a href="https://jfe.qualtrics.com/form/SV_eWE3b3l2YqZv56l"
										target="_blank">respond to the annual job market survey in Operations
										here</a>. <a href=
										"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15DxKOXE06x40BeD9phNi5Yuc-sE5l5bwN3OlKtBvI_Y">
										Here are some slides with results of this survey so far</a>.</span>
									</p>
									<p style='text-align: justify';><b>10. I have a suggestion
										to improve "Annual Job Market Survey", but would like to know the
										opinion of the rest.</b><br>
										Please <a href="https://operationsacademia.uservoice.com/" target=
										"_blank">submit your idea and/ or vote for already existing ones (you
										can even do so anonymously).

                    available job openings and the profiles of the PhD Candidates on the Job

                    Some FAQs regarding the Survey are the following:
                  </p>

                  <p style='text-align: justify'>
                    <b>1. Who should fill out the Survey?</b><br>
                    Whoever recently went through the Job Market search for an Operations related
                    academic position at a University/Business School, at any level (PostDoc,
                    Assist. Prof, Assoc. Prof, etc). Our Annual Job Market Survey asks you to
                    report the year you were on the Market and the year you are starting to work
                    (in case you defer an academic position for a PostDoc or a corporate offer).
                  </p>

                  <p style='text-align: justify'>
                    <b>2. What if I accepted a position as an Assistant Professor at an Industrial
                    Engineering/ Analytics/ etc department of a University (but not at its Business
                    School)?</b><br>
                    You should fill out our Survey, signaling though you are not joining a Business
                    School Department, at the respective question-section of the Survey.
                  </p>

                  <p style='text-align: justify'>
                    <b>3. What if I am graduating this (academic) year and accepted a position a
                    year from now, going for a year of PostDoc or some months in the Industry in
                    between?</b><br>
                    You should fill out our Survey mentioning you accepted a PostDoc or a position
                    in the industry till you start your academic position. <a href="contact"
                    target="_blank">Please contact us if anything is not clear</a>.
                  </p>

                  <p style='text-align: justify'>
                    <b>4. What do you plan to do with my data?</b><br>
                    We aim to create concrete annual reports, that would describe our field and
                    make our Job Market more transparent and efficient. <a href=
                    "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15DxKOXE06x40BeD9phNi5Yuc-sE5l5bwN3OlKtBvI_Y"
                    target="_blank">Here is a preliminary report from data collected in the very
                    first year we run this Annual Survey</a>. We are inspired by a <a href=
                    "http://docsig.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014-Who-Went-Where-Presentation.pdf"
                    target="_blank">similar Annual Survey that is being published in the field of
                    Marketing every year</a>.

                  <p style='text-align: justify'>
                    <b>5. I really liked the idea of having real data from the Operations Job
                    Market every year and better inform next generations of Operations PhDs and
                    Faculty. However, I am a bit hesitant to answer your Survey's sensitive salary
                    questions, mainly because I am afraid one could reverse engineer your report
                    and find out my identity. How would you deal with such cases?</b><br>
                    We are fully aware of these concerns and take them very seriously. We make sure
                    that your anonymity is assured in two ways. The first way is by not displaying
                    any data that can be traced back to individuals. Specifically, this means that
                    we do not display data (e.g. averages) that have less than three data points.
                    The second way is that these data will strictly not be accessed by anyone else
                    except the <a href="faqs" target="_blank">moderator of this
                    website</a><span style="background-color:transparent">, who will also not
                    disclose any data in any other way or form, except through the Annual Report.
                    For an example of how the data will (not) be displayed, see <a href=
                    "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15DxKOXE06x40BeD9phNi5Yuc-sE5l5bwN3OlKtBvI_Y"

                    tables on pp. 7-8 of the following similar <a href=

                  <p style='text-align: justify'>
                    <b>6. Hey, the Survey is not <i>really</i>&nbsp;anonymous, you may be able to
                    find out my identity! Please elaborate further.</b><br>
                    First of all, our academic community is not as small as you may think. Our
                    Survey is designed so that it can be answered by <i>any individual affiliated
                    to "Operations" (broadly defined), who went through our Job Market process in
                    the past</i> (provided he/ she remembers all the details we ask). This involves
                    PhD Candidates from a wide range of disciplines including, but not limited to,
                    Operations Research, Management Science, Industrial Engineering, Computer
                    Science, Financial Engineering and Analytics (among others), that have gone
                    through the "Operations Job Market" search.<br>
                    Second, we do not ask anything that the Marketing folks do not. Every year,
                    almost 95%(!) of the people who went on the Marketing Job Market (around 100
                    academics per year) fill up a respective Survey and keep their Job Market
                    greatly organized. We do not ask you to report your name (as they indeed do in
                    Marketing for verification reasons!), neither which institution you got your
                    PhD and where you finally ended up to. Sure, we do ask you though about how
                    many papers you had on the market, and their stage, your teaching load in your
                    current institution, the tenure requirements, and more details about your job
                    offer.<br>
                    Third, "<i>without action the world would still be an idea</i>" to rephrase a
                    famous quote of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Doriot" target=
                    "_blank">Georges Doriot</a>. Either you trust the researcher who is conducting
                    the Survey by accepting the detailed "<a href="informed-consent-statement"
                    target="_blank">Informed Consent Statement</a>", or not. Provided we collect
                    the right data though, we promise you a lot of insights that will be helpful
                    for future PhD Students, Universities/ Business Schools, and any academic of
                    our field. See for example the following recent executive summary reports by
                    the Marketing community (<a href=
                    "http://docsig.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/2013.pdf" target=
                    "_blank">2012-2013</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=
                    "http://docsig.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/2014WWW.pdf" target=
                    "_blank">2013-2014</a>).
                  </p>

                  <p style='text-align: justify'>
                    <b>7. To whom would this Survey be helpful?</b><br>
                    We believe that understanding the Business Schools' and Universities' job
                    offers and packages, and the average profiles of the Candidates will help both
                    parties to adjust their offers and expectations accordingly. Furthermore, our
                    vision is on how to attract the best (and the right) pool of researchers who
                    even want to <i>enter</i> our fields applying for a PhD. Reporting real data
                    will definitely help shaping the definition and the boundaries of "Operations
                    Academia".
                  </p>

                  <p p="" style='text-align: justify'>
                    <b>8. I was on the Job Market in the past, can I still fill out the
                    Survey?</b><br>
                    <i>Yes</i>, provided you remember well all the details of your job search
                    process including number of applications you sent, offers you got, etc. Our
                    Survey asks you to report the year you were in the job market.
                  </p>
